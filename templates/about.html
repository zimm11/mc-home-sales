                Python project analyzing Monroe County Home sales over the last 3 year period. CSV files of home sale data
                pulled from <a href="https://www.monroecounty.gov/etc/rp/search2.php">Monroe County Real Property Portal</a>.
                Utilizes the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy libraries to analyze and clean the data.

                The goal of the project is to utilize a machine learning library (scikit-learn) to create a model to predict
                home sale price based on the details and specifications of the home with at least 70% accuracy. After meeting
                this benchmark the model will be implemented into a web interface using the Flask framework so a user can
                receive a prediction for the sale price of their home.
