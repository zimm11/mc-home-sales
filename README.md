# Monroe County Home Sale Price Predictor

Python project analyzing Monroe County Home sales over the last 3 year period. CSV files of home sale data pulled from Monroe County Real Property Portal at https://www.monroecounty.gov/etc/rp/search2.php. Utilizes the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy libraries to analyze the data.  

The goal of the project is to utilize a machine learning libreary such as scikit-learn to create a model to predict home sale price based on the features and specifications of the home with at least 70% accuracy.  After meeting this benchmark I would like to create a user web interface using the Flask or Django frameworks so a user can receive a prediction for the saleprice of their home.  Project is in progress.
