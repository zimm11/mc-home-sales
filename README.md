# Monroe County Housing Data - Sale Price Prediction Project

Python project analyzing Monroe County Home sales over the last 3 year period. CSV files of home sale data pulled from Monroe County Real Property Portal at https://www.monroecounty.gov/etc/rp/search2.php. Utilizes the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy libraries to analyze and clean the data.

The project utilizes a machine learning library (scikit-learn) to create a model to predict home sale price based on the details and specifications of the home with 82% accuracy. The model has been implemented into a web interface using the Flask micro-framework so a user can receive a prediction for the sale price of their home based on their personal inputs.

Project completed by Christopher Zimmerman - Computer Information Systems student at Buffalo State College.
